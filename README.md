# Surveys

## Description

This project is an API to create and fill surveys

Requiriments:

- Users must be able to create an account and log in.
- When logged in, the project allows users to create and share surveys. 
- Each survey has many questions. 
- Each question has many options. For now we are going to support only single choice questions, but in the future we might support other type of questions.
- Anyone can fill a survey, they are going to be public.
- The owner of the survey can see the responses and a summary of the questions in a pie chart.
- All actions need to be done client side using AJAX. The page shouldn't reload.
- Minimal UX/UI . You will not be tested on this but try to keep it as tidy as possible.
- Use a REST API. It should be possible to perform all actions via the API.
- Only tests for the REST layer are required.

## How to used the APIüì¶

### Login User

#### create an User
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d'{"user": {"email": "b@a.com", "password": "test", "password_confirmation": "test"}}' http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users
```
Response: 
```bash
{"Authorization":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyfQ.4wBWO1V8e-2SpT_TqvZLsnAp6-SLTgbQZjyaMQpEqpY","id":2,"email":"b@a.com"}

You will use this Authorization as  header to make all the request.
